    "## Geoprocessing environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Geoprocessing environment settings are additional settings that affect geoprocessing tools. These settings provide a powerful way to ensure geoprocessing is performed in a controlled environment where you decide things such as the processing extent that limits processing to a specific geographic area, a coordinate system for all output geodatasets, or whether Z or M values should be included with the geoprocessing results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only certain environment settings will be used by a given geoprocessing tool. To determine the environments that a tool will use, consult the tool's documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `arcgis.env` module has globals to store such environment settings that are common among all geoprocessing tools. The code snippet below sets the spatial reference of the output geometries to 4326 (WGS84) :"

    "## Logging and error handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Geoprocessing tools log informative, warning and error messages using [logging facility](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html) for Python. These messages include such information as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the operation started and ended\n",
    "* The parameter values used\n",
    "* General information about the operation's progress (information message)\n",
    "* Warnings of potential problems (warning message)\n",
    "* Errors that cause the tool to stop execution (error message)\n",
    "\n",

For example, defining a coordinate system for a dataset that already has a coordinate system defined generates a warning. You can take action when a warning returns, such as canceling the tool's execution or making another parameter choice.</p></td></tr><tr class=\"align-middle\"><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><p id=\"GUID-EABB68CA-9063-4AD8-849A-4F3CCD02E7BB\">logging.ERROR</p></td><td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\"><p id=\"GUID-B44B04A0-42DB-4B3E-8B3A-95A4248F8451\">Error messages indicate a critical event that prevented a tool from executing.\n",
